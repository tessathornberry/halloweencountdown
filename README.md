# Halloween Countdown
My poem, "Halloween" broken down into one line or word per day of October, displayed with an accompanying piece of art I am painting in Photoshop. Each day's art and poetry is revealed as the month progresses. 

After Halloween, the full poem and all art will be revealed, and a link to the (currently private) repository at <a href="https://github.com/tessathornberry/halloween-countdown"> the actual repository</a> will be available shortly after for viewing.
