# Halloween Countdown
My poem, "Halloween" broken down into one line or word per day of October, displayed with an accompanying piece of art I am painting in Photoshop. Each day's art and poetry is revealed as the month progresses. Currently deployed at <a href="https://halloweencountdown.vercel.app/">https://halloweencountdown.vercel.app/</a>

After Halloween, the full poem and all art will be revealed!
